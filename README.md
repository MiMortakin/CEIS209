# Projects
<p>#Week 1: Created the Basic Foundation of Program</p>
<p>#Week 2:</p>
<p>#Week 3: Really rounded the program out with updating the validation, declaring arrays for each section (title, artist, genre, year, and url) this will also limit the number of songs allowed. Because of limited songs, the add button has to be edited to count the number of songs added. Add button function for finding a song, which will list the details in the Song Details. Created a Clear Song button, which empties the data fields. Now, added the ability to view the song via the added URL. This requires adding the Web View Control function (WebView2). What is viewing the song without playing it? Added a play song button.</p>
 <p>#Week 3 Challenge: Researched how to store (save) and then load song list. Microsoft had a good write up on this: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/developer/visualstudio/csharp/language-compilers/read-write-text-file - Save link for more C# help.</p>
